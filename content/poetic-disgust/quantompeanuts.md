The little switches
On the switchless
Stitched up wetwear
That outperforms
most of us
Typical stardust
Day dreaming
love lust
matinee streaming
Aren't meant to last
so you can play hard
Until you do bust
Whatever it was you meant
To keep shut
Instead you do rust
alone, isolated
withdrawn violated
your true self
could have been anything
or else, taken off the shelf
opened, resealed, exchanged
now your half off
can't make the deal
so you sit still
While entropy make a chill
eternal freeze
Escape into the void
pulled in post supernova
to begin
an ever ending disaster
necessary to create
a forever after


It's about those small quantum things in your brain that expidite signals moving across space and time.  
It's about time being space and what it takes to make something after all this becomes nothing.
